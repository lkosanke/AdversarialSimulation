## Proposal for Collaboration within our simulation structure

There exists substantial flexibility in the conduction of adversarial collaboration (AC) (Mellers et al., 2001;  Cowan, 2020; Melloni et al., 2021). The below presented approach tries to incorporate suggestions from the literature, while also introducing deviances due to our use case.

**First round: seperate studies:**

In order to have a starting point of different perspectives, as well as to be able to investigate whether AC shows incremental improvements over preregistration, a preliminary simulation study should be pursued by both researchers on their own.

<ins>Procedure

1. 2 seperate preregistrations = simulation protocol Morris et al. (2019)
    
    —> remaining RDoF/QRPs in operationalization, hypothesis generation, method selection and interpretation
    

*Open question*: Should we Red Team on our opposites preregistration? Would mitigate Bias and would differ from AC, as one would not have to follow critique if it feels unwarrented

2. 2 seperate implementations and interpretations

<br/>

**Second round: joint study**

Starting point: Results of first round. Either: 

1. contradicting findings
2. subjective interpretation of ambiguous results
3. clear reasoning for why results were not as hypothesized combined with strong opinion on what should be happening in the joint study

In any case: clear divide in opinions, ideal grounds for adversary!

<ins>Along the way:

Constant diary entry after each following part, judging the collaboration quality in a guided fashion, oriented on the diary by Shah & Leeder (2016).

Module: “Propose, Critique & Merge”: Oriented on a guideline including techniques such as in Kardos & Dexter (2017): Key assumption check, What if & counter arguments, Quality of information.

In emergencies as in fundamentally unresolvable disagreements, a third neutral arbiter (Aaron Peikert) should be consulted to try to resolve them.

<br/>

<ins>First part: Joint preregistration: Steps 1-8

Agree on a joint preregistration (including when which hyp. are accepted/ rejected, what are valid interpretations, which exact methods are to be chosen) (Mellers et al., 2001; Clark & Tetlock, 2021; Cowan et al., 2020)

Based on “individual proposal” i.e. revised initial preregistration of first study integrating its results

“Propose, Critique & Merge”

Verbal description of Simulation = simulation protocol Morris et al. (2019), as done in Pawel et al. (2023)

Should be as detailed and comprehensive as possible. Agreed upon steps as well as disagreements should be documented and resolved utilizing Github extensively.

<br/>

<ins>Second part: Coding & execution: Step 9

Individual proposals (code scripts)

“Propose, Critique & Merge”

Debugging should be done jointly.

In the end, all results should be present as defined in preregistration. 

Any changes from the preregistration should be argued and agreed upon, ideally on an empirical basis.

<br/>

<ins>Third part: Interpreting results, Discussion & implications: Step 10

Individual proposals

“Propose, Critique & Merge”

Map disagreements

Ideally, a joint Third part is generated. Alternatively, There have to be seperate interpretations and/ or discussion & implication parts.

<br/>

<ins>Fourth part: Reflecting on the AC

Individual proposals, based on the diaries

“Propose, Critique & Merge”

Map disagreements

After the substantial part of the study is over, a joint reflection of the AC should be pursued. Again, if disagreements persist, they should be mapped.

<br/>

<ins>Fifth part: Reporting & presentation: Step 11

Each side reports on their own thesis.
