Basis: literature research which included Papers from psychology, medicine, statistics and engineering.

Goals: Propose a structure that… 

- finds a balance of detail and abstraction along the entire process of a simulation study in our field of interest, from planning to presentation
- is compatible with other proposed structures.

The Papers displayed heterogeneity in their detail, overall and in specific areas of the simulation process, firstly, with regards to the use cases the authors are interested in. As we are interested in conducting a simulation study in the context of psychological methods, suggested structures by authors with engineering background were deemed to be less relevant (Law & Comas, 1991). Other papers, with a similar background in authorship, were explicitly meant to be interpreted broadly, which lead to a broad coverage of the topic as well, lacking relevant detail for our application (Shannon, 1992; Balco, 1990).

Besides these suggestions, other papers proposed sensible structures but for different purposes, for example to provide reporting guidelines or to advocate for the preemptive formulation of a simulation plan (Boomsma, 2013; Monks et al., 2019; Smith & Marshall, 2010). Two papers proposed an applicable structure but had a strong focus on the execution and coding of a simulation, on the cost of less detail on planning and preparation of the study (Paxton et al., 2001; Harwell et al., 1996). Similarly, a paper from Burton et al. (2006) proposed a good structure as well, but put a lot of focus on method-related decisions in the simulation procedure up until the evaluation of the results (Step 2-7). 

In consequence, my selected structure mainly corresponds to the proposed structure of Morris et al. (2019), with some exceptions. For reasons of parsimony, I merged their steps  “Estimand/ target of analysis” and “Methods” as this distinction was unique in comparison to other papers, and did not appear to contain additional information that would be lost in a common category (Burton et al., 2006; Harwell et al., 1996). Additionally, I added an optional step for model specification, as this section was part of some paper, as well as exemplary simulation studies (Smith & Marshall, 2010; Paxton et al., 2001; Beauducel & Wittmann, 2005). This step can be ommitted, depending on whether model specification is relevant to a planned simulation study or not.

For the labels of the structure, I oriented on all the papers mentioned to increase compatibility. Still, in terms of details of the steps, the structure corresponds to the paper of Morris and colleagues (2019).
