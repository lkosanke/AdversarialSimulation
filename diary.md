### Previous discussion
As you reflect on the last steps' discussion, think about the following questions:

1. Do you think you met your objectives for the past step? Explain how or why.
2. During the previous step, what kind of interactions you had with your collaborator (emails, chat, phone calls, face-to-face meetings)? Elaborate on your experience with each of these. 
3. How did you overcome the obstacles you saw before starting this step of collaboration? Which ones are still not addressed? 
4. Do you think your collaborator had influence on the work that you did individually? How or why?

### Upcoming discussion
As you reflect on the next steps' upcoming discussion, think about the following questions:
1. What are your groupâ€™s specific objectives for this step?
2. How do you plan on addressing them together?
3. What obstacles do you see on your side?

You are not expected to respond to each of these questions in any structured manner. If not relevant, questions can be omitted. 
If you want to add additional thoughts, feel free to so. These questions are provided merely to guide your thinking.
