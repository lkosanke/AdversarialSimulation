# **Preparation Framework**:

1. What is adversarial collaboration (AC)? How do we select a final proposal? (shared Zotero folder)
    - A priori ideas for Selection Criteria for Research Question
        - manageability
        - relevance
        - method fit
        - personal involvement
2. What kind of simulation study are we doing (in context of CFAâ€™s) (own Zotero folder)
3. Two proposals (2 pages each) per person, including AC, What? So what? Next what?
    1. Research question
    2. implementation
    3. success criteria for what is a good method (e.g., CFI) through simulation.
4. Merging proposals with selection criteria
5. Start Study

## Timetable

### Fast track

- start working: 1st week: finalize preperationsOctober 16, 2023
    
    1st todo: Create shared Zotero folder with Anna & Aaron input 
    
- agreement on selection criteria & shared understanding and outline of AC October 20, 2023
    
    includes: how to critique, revise and merge results
    
- Individual Proposals done by November 9, 2023
- 1 week for critique, improve, and merging
- Merged Proposal done and decision for / against AC  by November 16, 2023
- Starting work until exam preparation (2-3 weeks before exam) ~ January 20, 2024
- Exam break
- Finish afterwards until 15.03. March 15, 2024
